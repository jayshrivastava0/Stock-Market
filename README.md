**A robust and extensible Python toolkit for fetching financial data, visualizing market trends, and managing multi-asset portfolio performance over time.**



## Overview

The Portfolio Analytics Engine provides a foundational framework for quantitative financial analysis and portfolio management. It leverages industry-standard libraries to offer reliable data retrieval, insightful visualizations, and accurate tracking of portfolio holdings and value. Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, it serves as a powerful base for developing and testing sophisticated investment strategies and risk management techniques.

Whether you are an individual investor seeking better tools, a developer building fintech applications, or a quantitative analyst prototyping strategies, this engine offers core functionalities wrapped in a clean, well-documented, and test-covered codebase.



## Key Features (Current)

*   **Flexible Data Retrieval (`stock_plotter`):**
    *   Fetch historical stock price data (Close prices) from Yahoo Finance.
    *   Supports standard Yahoo Finance time periods (e.g., `1y`, `6mo`, `ytd`).
    *   Parses intuitive natural language date ranges (e.g., `"from 2022"`, `"this year"`).
    *   Handles relative time periods (e.g., `3M`, `10D`, `2W`).

    ```



## Usage Examples

### 1. Plotting Stock Trends (Command Line)

Use the `stock_plotter.py` script directly from your terminal:

```bash
# Plot Apple's stock price for the last year
python stock_plotter.py AAPL 1y

# Plot Microsoft's stock price from the start of 2023
python stock_plotter.py MSFT "from 2023"

# Plot Tesla's stock price for the last 6 months (relative)
python stock_plotter.py TSLA 6M

# Enable debug logging
python stock_plotter.py GOOGL 1mo --debug
```
*(Note: Plotting requires a graphical environment if `show=True`)*

### 2. Using Modules Programmatically (Python)

Integrate the engine's components into your own Python scripts:

```python
import pandas as pd
from stock_plotter import StockTrendPlotter
from portfolio_manager import PortfolioManager, InvalidInputError, DataFetchError

# --- Using StockTrendPlotter ---
try:
    plotter = StockTrendPlotter(ticker='NVDA', time_period='6mo')
    # Fetch data
    price_data = plotter.fetch_data()
    print("Fetched NVDA Data:\n", price_data.tail())
    # Generate plot object (don't show automatically)
    # fig = plotter.plot_trend(show=False)
    # fig.write_html("nvda_plot.html") # Save plot to file
except (ValueError, IOError) as e:
    print(f"Error plotting NVDA: {e}")

# --- Using PortfolioManager ---
initial_holdings = {'AAPL': 10, 'GOOGL': 5}
time_frame = '1y' # Data lookback period

try:
    manager = PortfolioManager(initial_portfolio=initial_holdings, time_period=time_frame)

    # Add portfolio changes (transactions)
    manager.add_change('2023-08-15', 'AAPL', '+5')    # Bought 5 more AAPL
    manager.add_change('2023-10-01', 'GOOGL', 2)     # Holdings adjusted to 2 GOOGL
    manager.add_change('2023-11-20', 'MSFT', 8)      # New holding MSFT
    manager.add_change('2023-12-05', 'AAPL', '-3')     # Sold 3 AAPL

    # Calculate portfolio history (fetches data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT)
    portfolio_history_df = manager.get_portfolio_data() # Builds if not already built

    if portfolio_history_df is not None:
        print("\nPortfolio History (Tail):\n", portfolio_history_df.tail())

        # Get portfolio composition for a specific date (or latest if None)
        composition_latest = manager.get_composition()
        composition_specific = manager.get_composition(date='2023-11-25') # Finds nearest if exact not found

        print("\nLatest Portfolio Composition (%):\n", composition_latest)
        print("\nPortfolio Composition on 2023-11-25 (%):\n", composition_specific)

except (InvalidInputError, DataFetchError, PortfolioBuildError) as e:
    print(f"Portfolio management error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```


## Testing

Unit tests are implemented using `pytest`. To run the tests:

1.  Ensure you have installed the development dependencies (if any are added later, e.g., `pytest-mock`). Currently, `pytest` is included in `requirements.txt`.
2.  Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
3.  Run `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pytest -v # -v for verbose output
    ```
    *(Note: Some tests may require network access to fetch sample data or interact with APIs indirectly via mocks)*



## Docker Support

A `Dockerfile` is provided to build a container image with the necessary environment and dependencies. This ensures consistency across different machines.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t portfolio-engine .
    ```

2.  **Run a container (example: execute a script):**
    You can run scripts within the container environment. Mount your local project directory to access your files inside the container.
    ```bash
    # Example: Run the stock_plotter script inside the container
    # (Note: Plotting directly might require X11 forwarding setup)
    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/app" portfolio-engine python stock_plotter.py AAPL 1mo

    # Example: Run an interactive python session inside the container
    docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/app" portfolio-engine python
    ```
