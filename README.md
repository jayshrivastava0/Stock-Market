# Stock Market Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the correlation between stock market movements and news sentiment. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which focuses on emotions (positive, negative, neutral), this project will explore whether specific keywords or linguistic patterns in financial news articles can serve as indicators for stock price fluctuations.

## Objective
The primary goal is to assess whether financial news articles contain signals that can predict stock market trends. Specifically, the project will:

- Extract and preprocess financial news data.
- Perform sentiment analysis focused on stock market movements rather than emotional tone.
- Identify key phrases and keywords that correlate with stock price changes.
- Test the hypothesis that certain words or patterns in news articles have predictive power over stock movements.

## Data Sources
- **Stock Market Data:** The project will use **Yahoo Finance API** to fetch historical stock prices, trading volume, and other relevant metrics.
- **News Data:** The source for financial news articles is yet to be decided, but potential options include NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage, or scraping financial news websites.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API.
   - Fetch financial news articles related to specific stocks or market indices.
2. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
   - Extract key phrases and word frequency distribution.
3. **Sentiment Analysis (Market-Oriented):**
   - Use NLP techniques to analyze financial terminology and trends.
   - Explore traditional sentiment models and fine-tune them for stock-related sentiment.
4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Examine the relationship between market sentiment scores and stock price fluctuations.
   - Identify leading indicators from news headlines and article content.
5. **Predictive Modeling (Future Scope):**
   - Use machine learning to build predictive models for stock movements based on news data.
   - Evaluate different modeling techniques such as regression, time series forecasting, and deep learning.

## Expected Outcomes
- A better understanding of whether financial news articles influence or predict stock prices.
- Identification of words or patterns that frequently correlate with market trends.
- Insights into the effectiveness of market-oriented sentiment analysis as a predictive tool.
- A potential foundation for developing an automated news-based stock trading strategy.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the choice of the news API for collecting financial news data.
- Implement data ingestion pipelines for stock and news data.
- Develop a sentiment analysis pipeline tailored for financial markets.
